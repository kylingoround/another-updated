The idea came to me when I realized that we live inside a media bubble, a fortitude of walls that limit our horizon as if the only border barrier matters is in the US. Indeed, there are only 3 prominent barriers in the west hemisphere.

Breaking free from this “prison” can be difficult as there are no official records or datasets about border barriers. So I started with a wikipedia page and started to put each barrier on the map:

<!-- ![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_D05655C47811550445C848F53FC5B1515762943486940BEB0178134B63D6576E_1567625444253_image.png) -->

There are over 40 barriers around the world. This map shows that most barriers centering around the Mid-East and the EU. This map, and a shift of perspective, illustrate a much different narrative and suggest a different center of attention.

# _How can I shift people’s attention from one dot to one globe?_

It is that moment I had this idea of building a wall of myself: a wall of walls, a virtual monument and a digital library of different fences and barriers placed side by side so they can challenge our biases and assumptions, and tell a story of their own.

Data is the paint for a data visualization project. While there isn’t a consolidated data source for border barrier issues itself, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_barrier) provides quite a starting point with a list of major barriers and their built status, length and purposes laid out. Some of them are not quite accurate or up-to-date during further inspection, but it provides a skeleton for me to add more information.

# Forming a Narrative

I had these three principles on the back of my mind for quite some time while I was binge-watching every barrier related documentary I could find, among them was the Vox Borders series. It tells stories on the borders I never heard of from the most fatal border in Melilla between Morocco and Spain, to a family-separating barrier across a river in India.

# Design Sketch

I started to create design sketch based on the idea of “literally putting every barrier side by side” along with a world map. Paring the data with border length was the initial plan because we tend to associate a barrier’s “seriousness” and “impact” with how long they are (which, as I discovered, is not true. The Melilla border is only 11km comparing with the 1000km existing US-Mexico wall, yet the former is the most fatal one for migrants).

# User Testing

I had an opportunity user testing this demo version in an exhibition hosted by NYU. I had the chance to talk to people who have experiences living near the border and to hear the stories how border barriers impacted their lives and families.

Thanks to the user testing, I had a few other discoveries:

<BulletPoint>
- Maps are distracting
</BulletPoint>

Map visualizations are difficult to make. They are distractingly complex and beautiful, but they often rob you the center of focus from whatever topic or statement you want to emphasize to the map itself.

<BulletPoint>
- “So, which one is the Great Wall?”
</BulletPoint>

There are only about 3 walls that most people interested about, then they move on.

_(If you have been trying to formulate your own top 3 barriers, they are: Great Wall of China, the Berlin Wall and the UX-Mexico Wall)_

Having length being the most prominent data associated with border also nudged people to search for their most knowledgable and lengthy border barrier, which didn’t work so well for my narrative of encouraging people to discover unheard and unfamiliar scenes and places.

<BulletPoint>
- “Border experts” are interested to learn more
</BulletPoint>

People who do have more knowledge of other barriers tended to seek out particular barriers, such as the West Bank barrier, and their data. They look for more in-depth knowledge of the ones they are interested.

With those feedbacks, I modified my design to emphasize on the individuality of each border barrie. I also reduced map’s importance.

<!-- ![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_D05655C47811550445C848F53FC5B1515762943486940BEB0178134B63D6576E_1567647927111_image.png) -->

I also started to look into more in-depth data related with each country using World Bank’s API. Here is a comparison between four countries with their GDP, population, GNI and life expectancy data on both sides of a border wall. Researchers show that barriers are usually built by countries with power or wealth to fend off the poor and I was looking for ways to illustrate this point.

These two sketches show an interface to investigate such in-depth data with the borderline in the background to provide more context.

I also started to play with the idea of creating an icon system that dynamically generate an icon for each border illustrating various physical properties and technical spec on each border. Some borders have barbed wire, some are made of steel, some are equipped with drones and some are electrified.

# The Final Design

My final design was influenced heavily by my prototyping experience. Some aspects of my design sketch were based upon data I did not have access (the data property data) to and some were very time-consuming to develop (the border / barrier shape data). Part of the problem can be solved by pouring more hours into the data collection process, part can’t because I lack the crucial journalism and critic resources in the process of making a valid data set. But I kept the core idea of providing a visualization and a platform to discover each barrier as an equivalent individual.

# Resolve

<!-- ![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_D05655C47811550445C848F53FC5B1515762943486940BEB0178134B63D6576E_1567716870306_image.png) -->

Ultimately, my journey about making this data visualization is about discovery. By looking into different borders and barriers, and their neighboring countries, I developed a more profound understanding of the geography and politics in different regions, and a better understanding of the migrant issue. Those border constructions are more than just physical constructions, but physical manifests of our differences, conflicts and self-interests.

<!-- ![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_D05655C47811550445C848F53FC5B1515762943486940BEB0178134B63D6576E_1567716772990_image.png) -->

Most photography of those barriers and fences are taken from a front perspective, signifying their majestic height and weight. We rarely see a bird’s eye view because such perspective would reduces a wall into a line, and shifts our attentions to the separated vastness. A vastness of lands, animal habitats, rivers and families that cares little about those self-entitled borders.

Perhaps the most unique barrier of all is a barrier that not listed in my data visualization: Berlin. Its destruction means more than its own construction. With its take down, one would hope for a more united and open world. Alas, besides of providing kindness to people around as, I would love to continue to work on this project in the following categories:

# Collaborations on Open Data

Sharing one’s work and inviting people to collaborate is the true spirit of open source and open data. I would love to see how researchers or people who had experiences living on border would contribute to the barrier data set. The most rewarding aspect of this project was talking to people about different perspectives and experiences, and I want to embrace this collaborative aspect in the next phrase of this project. This might include provides tools to edit and collaborate on datasets. (Yay more interfaces to design and to code.)

## Researchers and Journalists

I’d love to reach out to researchers and journalists to see how they would use this visualization and what changes they wish to make.

## Migrants and Refugees

Sharing information can be a powerful way to voice someone’s concern, but I also want to look into what information that can be helpful to migrants from legal advice to migrant routes.
