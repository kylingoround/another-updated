# Introduction

SMEs (Small-to-Medium Enterprises) are said to be the backbones of economics in many countries, contributing to over 60% of GDP in China and 44% in America. Bank of China was working with partners to host a conference in which SME from both country will have a 1-on-1 meeting to discuss potential partnership. I worked with a team of developers, project managers and the client to create a website that display key information such as location and time, and let SME users sign up and pair with each other. Key challenges of this project included creating a visual design that complies with client’s branding guidelines; simplify a registration process; creating responsive web design and collaborating closely with each team member to meet a tight deadline.

We started as reviewing business requirements with this project. Our client manager and project manger put together a collection of main feature requests, branding material, copy-writings and sponsor requirements. After reviewing the guidelines and restrictions, I started to create a rough userflow. The main challenge was to design an information page and a registration page and having them connected seamlessly, making sure the procedure and information complies with client’s requirements, while not putting too much pressure on the developers. After we settled on an iteration of wireframe, I started to create high-fidelity visual design based on client’s branding guide. Lastly, I tested the website closely with developers for responsiveness and usability before launching the site.

# Userflow

Creating an userflow with clarity was essential for this project. I divided the site architecture in two parts: login/register and profile; and main website. Main website advertises crucial information about this event such as location, time, contacts and purpose of the event while serving a portal for interested users to register and go through the pairing process. Once the user registered, they can access a profile page to complete or modify their information.

We used to have the registration and profile parts bundled up, requiring users to fill in all the information including interested partners, during the registration process, with little means to review or modify these information after completion. This iteration suffered terrible usability issues and put too much mental burden on new users. Thus, I decided to break down the registration / profile process. It put extra work on our developers as they need to develop a standalone user profile section now, but I think the huge usability improvements and the ease of mind were worth the while.

I created wireframe for both website and mobile layout based on the userflow. This wireframe was used to discuss with project managers to see if they satisfy client’s requirements, and was used to discuss time, budget and technical feasibility with developers.
