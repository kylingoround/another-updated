Video game has spiraled into a 60-billion-dollar business. As the industry shifts towards a Game-as-a-Service business model to support the increasing cost of AAA games, the industry leaders including Google, Nintendo, and Sony are looking at ways to expand customer service from a fail-safe into a new value proposition.

Method worked with a game publisher to reimagine the future of CX in gaming. Collaborated with stakeholders, players behavior analysts, and competitive research, we mapped out how current siloed workstreams impacted player's experience, what best practices can we adapt to evolve its support portal, and how modern technology can augment the Customer Service Representatives to provide fast and contextual, and even automated services.

At the end of the engagement, we helped the support teams defined a vision of the future that is ubiquitous and personalized, and support can work alongside the gaming community to enrich a player's experience beyond screens, integrating tutorial, streaming, forum, and social media in the loop. We also provided an MVP to help the product team in its first step of digital migration.

I worked on interview synthesis, creating customer journey, competitive/comparable analysis, and later creating information architecture, mockup, and prototype for the web support portal.
