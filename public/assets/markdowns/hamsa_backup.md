# Introduction

- How can we create new ways to build interpersonal connections in VR?
- How do we innovate VR interfaces with gesture-control?
- What are the boundaries of story-telling in VR?

Those were the questions our team explored in the three-day event of MIT’s Reality, Virtually Hackathon! The result is Hamsa - a story-driven, two-player puzzle experience in which one player literally transforms into a pair of magic hands.

**Team formation**: I worked with two developers and an animator while I focused on UX, concept-development, moderating, story-telling, storyboard / wireframe and user-testing.

# Problem

Imagine you just bought a pair of VR goggles and want to show it off to your best friend. But most VR games are for single-player only, meaning one of you will sit on the bench and watch. You proceed to ask your friend to try the goggles on and to try out your favorite VR game: [Virtual Rick-ality](https://www.adultswim.com/games/pc-console/rick-and-morty-simulator-virtual-rick-ality/)! Your friend starts to look around with amaze and excitement. On the other hand, even though you know the gameplay by heart, You still feel left out. It’s like watching someone playing the new God of War except you can’t see the screen.

That experience, sitting on the bench, kind of sucks.

What if we find some ways to simply let people peek into their friend’s VR journey? Not only seeing from your friend’s perspective, but also a zoomed-out view of the landscape like a movie?

Ok. Let’s not stop there. You poke a spot on the display and a giant fireball rains down, barely misses your friend’s avatar.

Oops.

But isn’t that kind of fun?

# Brainstorming

**Problems**: interesting interactions between two players

**Contexts**: one player uses leap motion and display, one player using HTC vive

Once we nailed down the the problem and decided to create a hybrid, inter-personal experience, we started to sketch out different ideas of interactions and scenarios. At first we thought about activities such as farming and dodge ball: things that people can do together. Then we started to think about the relationship between two avatars, which we dubbed as the Giant Hands / Genie and the Lilliput (because it’s small). After all, they have different avatars and we should leverage that.

The Lilliput is small but flexible. He can explore the world from the first-person perspective. The Genie / Giant-hands is giant and mighty, looking down on the world from a bird eyes' view.

I created some paper prototype to visualize our ideas.

# Building

After consolidating our ideas, I created mockup to help the team decide which scenarios we want to build. We knew that there will be an introduction scenes and we need something that packed a punch. We also explored other ideas such as music and puzzles and made demos to test them out ourselves.

# Challenge: Communication

One of the challenges we faced was to design communication between two players since they can’t talk to each other nor text. Naturally people started to communicate with each other through body-language such as waving hands / arms. We added the ability for Genie to draw lines on the screen and we expected it to be an expressive way to communicate.

Turns out, drawing on a 2D plane, with reversed perspective and lack of hand-tracking accuracy made the drawing much more difficult to understand.

# Observation: Jump-scare still works

We didn’t tell our VR participants there would be a second player, nor how 2P would be introduced. So the first time they met would be a “breaking the fourth wall” experience in which a giant pair of hands break one of the wall in VR player’s starting area.
**Takeaway**: Using immersive way to introduce two people in their in-game avatars and it helps people get into characters quicker.

# Observation: Playing Music is fun

Among our experiments of collaborative events we tested, “concert” was the most popular. Simply put some color rocks on the ground and people can go nuts even though what they played weren't so musical. The interaction took no time to learn and soon people want to collaborate with on another.

**Takeaway**: music instruments are creative, fun social instruments and they are easy to implement!

# Observation: Physics is fun

In one of our scenes, we decorated our environment with big giant apples (why … apples? I had no idea. Someone must loves giant vegetables…) and in our play testing many people try to grab and interact with the apples. Once we made those apples interactive with grabbing, throwing and catching, people started to pass the apples with each other and had some dodge ball experiences.
**Takeaway**: add objects that can be interacted by both players will encourage communication through actions.

# Wrapping-up

We had a lot fun building and testing this project. We experimented innovative ways for people to communicate in VR / hybrid environment and we created some interesting playgrounds for people to explore.

But if we can push this project in a more commercial way, here are few areas we would like to expand:

- add more musical instruments, and a recording feature so people can share those moments on social media
- improve body-language-based communication: using gestures to create animoji might be a better alternative than writing
- add more physics-based interactions with environment: people loved them and we want to provide them.

Thank you for reading!
