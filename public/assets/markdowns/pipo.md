# INTRODUCTION

Pipo is a mobile local event sharing and discovering app. It was inspired by grassroots event-organizing among Chinese young people within WeChat, a dominating Messaging app in China. This case study focuses on how did we select our core audiences through user researches and competitive analysis, and developed early Minimum Viable Product for future iterations.

# THE CHALLENGE

There are over 16,000 Chinese students living in New York. 30% of foreign students in the U.S. are Chinese. And they don’t use Meet-ups or Eventbrites to find their social life. They use WeChat.

From grabbing a drink from the new bubble tea shop to finding buddies for a board game night, WeChat group brings strangers in the same neighborhood together.
What can this unique culture phenomenon brings?

# DEFINING USERS

I conducted a preliminary research with our marketing specialist, surveying over 500 people from various schools in New York. My hypothesis was that there are two type of people: Organizers who love to host events and Attendees who join events. We want to find out how rare organizers are, and what people’s preference towards socializing with strangers. Our initial survey’s results were promising as most people are totally cool with socialize with strangers. While Organizers were very few (10% to 30%). From there we concluded that our core users are organizers - lifeblood in our event ecosystem - and active social attenders. The third group are people who tend to join events in which their friends are in presence, not a focus but can be great product ambassadors if
we nail our user experience.

# SITEMAPS AND INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE

From there I created information architecture and site-map that would help our team develop a more concrete idea of our app’s shape. We had a lot of technical discussions of different feature, such as Chatroom being a resource-intensive feature to develop that was postponed.

# LOW-FIDELITY MOCK-UP AND PROTOTYPES

I proceeded to create low-fidelity and medium-fidelity prototypes for internal user testing. We can have more concrete and detailed discussion about our core experiences of creating, discovering and managing events.

# CREATING VISUAL IDENTITY

These prototypes while being great for usability testing among our own, can be challenging to outside users who don’t share a lot of knowledge of product features. They might also have a biased first impression from the shabby appearance. Also I need to give our marketing something if they need ever to do a sales pitch. So I started to look into developing our visual identity.
I was looking for something clean, light-weighted, flat and have some differentiating qualities. I created this mood board with some visualizations, a set of open-sourced animal avatars our team really loved and two great map-based apps that we took a lot of inspirations from.

After studying and experimenting those visual elements, I created current version of visual design. It missed some places such as motion transitions and color, but I think this is a good starting ground. The following step illustrates how user can browse and discover a list of events from the map tab.

# WHAT’S NEXT

So far we have laid the foundations for our applications. My views of MVP - minimum viable product - was not about shipping a skeleton product to our users, but a nice chassis that make future features easier to implement and iterate. It was the “boring work” so we can start to have some fun.
I have been thinking about building a “peek-inside-the-party” experience in which you, as represented by the flamingo, is holding down on screen and hovering between the decision of joining or quitting while judging the personalities of “players on court”, instead of just a plain-old “Join” button. Or maybe we can ask everyone around you if they know how to play Cards Against Humanity or want to watch new episode of Game of Throne.

So this is the next step. There will be more iterations based on user feedback before and after our initial launch, and then there’s the fun parts that hopefully will create a unique and memorable experiences to our users. I just can’t wait
